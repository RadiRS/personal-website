# Warunggaib

Warunggaib is one of the online marketplaces in Indonesia. However, this marketplace has its own uniqueness, namely selling antiques and traditional Indonesian characteristics. The target of this market is usually collectors who like to collect antiques.

## Process

This app was developed from scratch. I developed this application based on all the experiences from previous projects. The time required from initial development to release takes one year. Here are some features I've worked on in app development:

- Implementation of the UI into the application
- Integration with API and Back End Team
- User authentication (Email, Google, Apple & FB)
- Global state management
- User transactions
- Release to PlayStore & AppStore
- etc..

## Tech

Warunggaib uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Javascript framework for mobile apps!
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - Google-backed application development for iOS, Android and Web apps.
- [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) - Continuously build, test, release, and monitor apps for every platform.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - Routing and navigation for Expo and React Native apps.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps
- [One Signal](https://onesignal.com/) - Customer engagement solution for Push Notifications, Email, SMS & In-App.

## Result

After going through various challenges and revisions, the application can finally be released to the public. This has been a valuable experience where I can work with a solid team and can contribute to their product development.
