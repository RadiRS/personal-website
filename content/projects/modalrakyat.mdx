## Modal Rakyat

**Modal Rakyat** is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) investment application based in
Indonesia. It enables investors or lenders to provide loans to various MSMEs
(Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) in Indonesia, helping to support and grow
their businesses.

## Development Process

I was an integral part of the Modal Rakyat development team, contributing from
the initial stages through to the public release. The project spanned
approximately a year before the first version was launched. Hereâ€™s an overview
of my contributions:

- UI implementation
- API integration and collaboration with the backend team
- User authentication setup
- Global state management
- Bug fixes and continuous improvements
- Managed releases to PlayStore, AppStore, and AppGallery

## Technology Stack

Modal Rakyat is powered by several open-source technologies:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - A JavaScript
  framework for mobile app development.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - Google-backed app development
  platform for iOS, Android, and web apps.
- [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) - A platform for continuous build, testing,
  release, and monitoring of apps.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - Routing and navigation for
  Expo and React Native apps.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state container for JavaScript
  apps.
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) - An open-source error tracking tool with
  full stack traces and asynchronous context.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - Allows writing
  actual CSS in JavaScript.

## Achievements

After more than two years with Modal Rakyat, I was promoted to Tech Lead Mobile
Developer. I continue to contribute to the development of new features,
including a significant UI overhaul and performance improvements in version
1.0.0 (stable). The application remains in active development, continuously
evolving to meet user needs.
