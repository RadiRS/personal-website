## Warunggaib

Warunggaib is a distinctive online marketplace in Indonesia, catering to
collectors and enthusiasts of antiques and traditional Indonesian artifacts.
Unlike conventional marketplaces, Warunggaib offers a specialized platform for
those who appreciate the cultural heritage and uniqueness of these items.

## Development Process

The development of Warunggaib started from scratch, leveraging the experiences
gained from previous projects. It took approximately one year to bring this
application from initial concept to release. Here are some of the key features I
worked on during the appâ€™s development:

- **UI Implementation**: Developed a user-friendly interface that enhances the
  shopping experience.
- **API Integration**: Worked closely with the Back-End team to ensure seamless
  data flow.
- **User Authentication**: Integrated multiple authentication options, including
  Email, Google, Apple, and Facebook.
- **Global State Management**: Implemented a scalable state management solution.
- **User Transactions**: Enabled secure and efficient transaction processes.
- **Release**: Successfully launched the app on the PlayStore and AppStore.

## Technology Stack

Warunggaib utilizes a robust set of open-source technologies to deliver a
seamless user experience:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - A JavaScript
  framework for building native mobile apps.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - A comprehensive development platform

contributing to this unique project has been incredibly rewarding.
