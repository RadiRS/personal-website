## Otuchat

Otuchat is a feature-rich messenger application that goes beyond simple
communication. It offers integrated payment and transaction features, allowing
users to transfer money and purchase mobile top-ups (Pulsa) directly within the
app.

## Development Process

Throughout the development of Otuchat, I contributed to several key features
that enhanced the app's functionality:

- **Profile Update Feature**: Enabled users to update their profile information
  seamlessly.
- **Native Module Access**: Integrated access to native modules like the camera
  and gallery, enriching the user experience.
- **QR Code Generator**: Developed a QR code generation feature for easy sharing
  and transactions.
- **Bug Fixes and Improvements**: Continuously improved the appâ€™s stability and
  performance.

## Technology Stack

Otuchat leverages a variety of open-source technologies to deliver a robust and
user-friendly experience:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - A powerful
  JavaScript framework for building mobile apps.
- [RN Background Timer](https://github.com/ocetnik/react-native-background-timer) -
  A background timer module for React Native apps.
- [RN QR Code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-qrcode-svg) - A QR
  code generator for React Native.

## Outcome

Through the development and continuous improvement of Otuchat, we have created a
versatile application that not only facilitates communication but also empowers
users with convenient payment and transaction features.
