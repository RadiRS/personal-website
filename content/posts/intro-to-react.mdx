### Introduction

React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. Extremely popular
declarative, component-based, state-driven javascript library for builder user
interfaces, created by Facebook.

- Based on components: Components are the building block of user interfaces in
  React.
- Declarative: how components look like and how they work using a declarative
  syntax called **JSX** based on current **data/state**. JSX is a syntax that
  combines HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as referencing other components.
- State-driven: react to state changes by re-rendering the UI.

### Is React a library or a framework?

Ans: React is a library because it is only the “view” layer. We need to pick
multiple external libraries to build a complete application.
