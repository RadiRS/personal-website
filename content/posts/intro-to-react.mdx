### Introduction

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Created by
Facebook, it’s widely used due to its **component-based**, **declarative**, and
**state-driven** nature.

- **Component-based**: UI is broken down into small, reusable pieces like
  headers, footers, and buttons.

- **Declarative**: React uses **JSX** syntax, combining HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript to define the UI based on data and state.

- **State-driven**: React automatically updates the UI when data (state)
  changes. ![react-to-state](/images/posts/state-react-to-ui.png)

### Is React a Library or Framework?

React is a **library** focused only on the “view” layer. For building full
applications, developers need additional tools like routing or state management
libraries.

### Starting a React Project

Here are popular tools to start a React project:

- [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev): Recommended for
  beginners, but for production, it's suggested to use frameworks like Next.js.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): A fast, modern alternative with built-in
  TypeScript and ESLint support.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A React framework with advanced features like
  **SEO optimization**, **server-side rendering**, and routing. Great for
  building full-stack apps.

Other React-based tools include [Remix](https://remix.run/) and
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

### React vs. Vanilla JavaScript

Below is a comparison of traditional VanillaJS and React.

**VanillaJS Example**:

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div id="value">0</div>
    <div>
      <button id="more">+</button>
      <button id="less">-</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
<script>
  const value = document.querySelector('#value');
  const more = document.querySelector('#more');
  const less = document.querySelector('#less');

  const incrementHandler = () => {
    value.textContent = +value.textContent + 1;
  };

  const decrementHandler = () => {
    value.textContent = +value.textContent - 1;
  };

  more.addEventListener('click', incrementHandler);
  less.addEventListener('click', decrementHandler);
</script>
```

**ReactJS Example**:

```jsx
const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>+</button>
        <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter - 1)}>-</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

As shown, React code is more concise, reusable, and easier to manage, especially
for larger applications.

### ReactJS vs. VanillaJS: Key Differences

1. **UI Building**:

   - **ReactJS**: Reusable components.
   - **VanillaJS**: Repeated DOM manipulation.

2. **DOM Manipulation**:

   - **ReactJS**: Uses a virtual DOM for better performance.
   - **VanillaJS**: Direct DOM access can slow down larger applications.

3. **State Management**:

   - **ReactJS**: State updates automatically trigger UI changes.
   - **VanillaJS**: Requires manual tracking and updates.

4. **Learning Curve**:

   - **ReactJS**: Requires learning JSX, hooks, and React-specific tools.
   - **VanillaJS**: Easier to start but harder to scale.

5. **Ecosystem**:
   - **ReactJS**: Rich ecosystem with built-in tools.
   - **VanillaJS**: Requires custom solutions or third-party libraries.

### Summary

ReactJS offers a modern, efficient way to build dynamic, scalable web apps,
especially compared to VanillaJS, which can become cumbersome for larger
projects. It excels with reusable components, state management, and a rich
ecosystem, making it ideal for more complex applications.
