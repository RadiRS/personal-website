# Modal Rakyat

Modal Rakyat is a Peer To Peer-based investment application located in Indonesia. In this application Investors or Lenders can provide loans to several MSMEs in Indonesia to help their business.

## Process

In the process I was included in one of the application development teams. There were several stages in the development of this application, and I contributed quite a lot because I was involved from the beginning of the development to the release stage. It takes approximately a year to release the first version of the application to the public. Here are some of the work I've done up to the last version of the app:

- Implementation of the UI into the application
- Integration with API and Back End Team
- User authentication
- Global state management
- Fixed bugs and improvements
- Release to PlayStore, AppStore & AppGallery
- etc..

## Tech

Modal Rakyat uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Javascript framework for mobile apps.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - Google-backed application development for iOS, Android and Web apps.
- [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) - Continuously build, test, release, and monitor apps for every platform.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - Routing and navigation for Expo and React Native apps.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps.
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) - Open-source error tracking with full stacktraces & asynchronous context.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - Styled Components lets you write actual CSS in your JavaScript.

## Result

After more than two years of being part of the team, I was trusted to become the Tech Lead Mobile Developer of Modal Rakyat. As a result I continue to participate in the development of other new features. Until now, the application continues to be improved and one of the big features is a change in appearance from the first version and an increase in application performance in version 1.0.0 (stable).
